## Software Development Processes and Methodologies
Software is quickly becoming integral part of human life as we see more and more automation and technical advancements. Just like we expect car to work all the time and can't afford to break or reboot unexpectedly, software industry needs to continue to learn better way to build software if it were to become integral part of human life.

In this course,  you will get an overview of  how software teams work? What processes they use?  What are some of the industry standard methodologies? What are pros and cons of each?  You will learn enough to have meaningful conversation around software development processes.

After completing this course, a learner will be able to 
1) Apply core software engineering practices at conceptual level for a given problem. 
2) Compare and contrast traditional, agile, and lean development methodologies at high level.  These include Waterfall, Rational Unified Process, V model, Incremental, Spiral models and overview of agile mindset

In previous 4 years, a retail bank sold several products (mortgage account, savings account, and pension account) to it's customers. It kept records of all historical data, and this data is available for analysis and reuse. Following a merger in 2021, the bank has new customers and wants to launch some marketing campaigns.

Standard business process for Deposit opening in the bank is described very well in the BPNM diagram bellow:

The budget for the campaigns is limited. The bank wants to contact a customer and propose only one product.

The marketing department needs to decide:

Who should be contacted?

Which product should be proposed? (Proposing too many products is counter productive, so only one product per customer contact will be proposed).

How will a customer be contacted? There are different ways, with different costs and efficiency.

How can they optimally use their limited budget?

Will such campaigns be profitable?
