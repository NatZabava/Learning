## Introduction
Business Analytics and Business Intelligent are one of the fastest growing sectors in Data Science and this project is my result to dive deeply into the practical problems from the real world using my ML and Visualization skills for a business purposes.   
 
The project contains some [graphics materials]( https://github.com/Kochurovskyi/Business_Analytics/tree/main/Tableau) of data exploratory, descriptive and prescriptive analysis. For an easy access this folder also contains another readme-file with all links to a relevant files on my [Tableau Public Profile]( https://public.tableau.com/profile/yukochu#!/).

Another important part  of the project is [Jupyter (Python) Notebook]( https://github.com/Kochurovskyi/Business_Analytics/blob/main/MarketingCampaign_model.ipynb) with all predictive, prescriptive and clusterization models developed in python with all notes and explanations. 
  
  All conclusions and addition information you will find here in this readme-file.
  Besides the project itself this folder contains all practical exercises made by me taking the Coursera Courses: Data Visualization with Tableau and Advanced Business Analytics Specializations I have successfully finished before start this project. All details related to Coursera Specializations you can find in the end of the file.


## Marketing campaign strategy. Promoting financial products to bank customers

In previous 4 years, a retail bank sold several products (mortgage account, savings account, and pension account) to it's customers. It kept records of all historical data, and this data is available for analysis and reuse. Following a merger in 2021, the bank has new customers and wants to launch some marketing campaigns.

Standard business process for Deposit opening in the bank is described very well in the BPNM diagram bellow:

The budget for the campaigns is limited. The bank wants to contact a customer and propose only one product.

The marketing department needs to decide:

Who should be contacted?

Which product should be proposed? (Proposing too many products is counter productive, so only one product per customer contact will be proposed).

How will a customer be contacted? There are different ways, with different costs and efficiency.

How can they optimally use their limited budget?

Will such campaigns be profitable?
